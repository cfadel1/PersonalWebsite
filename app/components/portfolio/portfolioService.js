It uses an Android mobile application to which text can be supplied either from a digital format or a photograph. The text is discerned using image processing and then via Bluetooth, displayed on a portable refreshable braille cell. This project was created as our fourth-year design project and received an Award for Most Potential Futuristic Application.'

Researched on convolutional neural networks for image classification. This research is documented in the blog section under Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification. A simple python script was also written that trains a neural network for image classification using TensorFlow.'
